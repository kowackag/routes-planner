### **Solutions provided in the project:**
- HTML:
    - The project was built using semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS:
    - The css styles are created using `styled-components`.
    - The `Custom Checkbox` and `Dropdown` was created.
    
- JS:
    - ES2015+ (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator) was used.
    - To store all communication with the API in one place, the function DataAPI was created (in the separated file `DataAPI.js`).
    - Communication with API is based on `fetch()` method.
    - To run the project using browsers that do not support `fetch()` method, package `whatwg-fetch` was used.
    - All fields are validated .
- React:
    - The following hooks were used: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext` and `Custom Hook`.
    - Components are split and kept in smaller ones.
    - `Font Awesome` ikons was used in  React app thanks to `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`.
    - I used from `react-to-print` to add possibility to print effects of application.


I had opted to use `styled-components` as a solution for managing the CSS.

To make coding with `styled-component` more comfortable, I used a special Extension in Visual Studio Code `vscode-styled-components`.

I used the `createGlobalStyle` function from styled-components and added reset style and some global styles (`Reset.js` and `Global.js`)

Data during working app are saved and store in [localStorage](http://kursjs.pl/kurs/storage/storage.php) built into a web browser.

&nbsp;

The custom hook `useStorage` was created, to provide methods for saving and reading data from localStorage:
```
export const useStorage = () => {
  const setToLS = (ob, name) => {
    localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify(ob));
  };
  const getFromLS = (name) => {
    const retrivedObject = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(name));
    return retrivedObject;
  };
  return [getFromLS, setToLS];
};
```

The hook `useStorage` was used in Components:
```
const [getFromLS, setToLS] = useStorage();
```
